## Thanks
* Andrew Braybrook for the original Paradroid. All sound effects are borrowed
from the Commodore 64 version of the original game.
* Thank you to Dave Glowacki and David Schultz, for assistance with the deck
accessibility algorithm idea. Piss-poor implementation to be blamed completely
on @blinkdog.
* `img/terminal8x8.png` borrowed from [Necromancer Simulator 2014](https://github.com/maqqr/7drl2014)
then given an alpha channel to make it usable as rot.js tileset
