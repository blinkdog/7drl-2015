My entry for Seven Day Roguelike (7DRL) Challenge 2015

## Development Log

* 149 - Sound effect support, looping briefing sample
* 148 - Briefing content, but not briefing code; too sleepy

* 079 - All(?) sound effects
* 076 - Lifts that ensure all decks can be accessed

## Thanks
* Dave Glowacki and David Schultz, for assistance with the deck
accessibility algorithm idea. Piss-poor implementation to be blamed
completely on @blinkdog.
